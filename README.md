# HangmanGame built with React + TypeScript ðŸŽ®

This project is a practical application I built as part of a React training at Rocketseat ðŸš€.
It's a classic Hangman Game, where the player has to guess the correct word, one letter at a time!

ðŸš€ Tech Highlights:
Built with React and TypeScript

â€¢ Developed using Vite for fast development and optimized build

â€¢ Deployed with Vercel for easy and efficient hosting

â€¢ Utilized core React hooks like useState and useEffect

â€¢ Created custom hooks to manage game logic and state

â€¢ Used props to handle component communication

â€¢ Clean and modular component structure

This project helped me reinforce key React concepts in a fun and interactive way.
Feel free to clone it, play with it, and maybe even improve it! Contributions are welcome ðŸ˜‰
